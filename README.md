How to use
=================


Include 'geoware' in your `INSTALLED_APPS` somewhere after `'django.contrib.gis'`.

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'some apps go here',
      'django.contrib.gis',
      'some other apps can go here',
      'geoaware',
      'some other apps can go here',
   ]
   ```

To include GeoIP related info in the session:
    
    Include geoaware middleware in your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` after the session middleware.

   ```python
   MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
      'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
      'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
      'some middleware can go here',
      'geoaware.middleware.GeoAwareSessionMiddleware',
      'some more middleware can go here',
   ] 
   # The GeoIP related info would be available in request.session['geo_info']
   ```

To include GeoIP related info in the context:
    
   Include geoware context processor in your `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` after `'django.core.context_processors.request'`.
   
   ```python
   TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = [
      'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
      'some context processor can go here',
      'django.core.context_processors.request',
      'some context processor can go here',
      'geoaware.context_processors.geoaware',
      'some context processor can go here',
   ]
   # The GeoIP related info would be available in your context as geo_info.
   ```

To access the GeoIP data:

   Note that geo_info is a dictionary that includes the following:
   ```python
   geo_info = {
      'fqdn_or_ip': '',
      'city': '', 
      'continent_code': '', 
      'region': '',
      'charset': 0,
      'area_code': 0,
      'longitude': 0.0,
      'country_code3': '',
      'latitude': 0.0,
      'postal_code': None,
      'dma_code': 0,
      'country_code': '',
      'country_name': '',
   }
   # If some fields are not available they are left unpopulated.
   ```

To access the GoeIP data via template tags:

The following filters are available for extracting specific GeoIP data in the templates.
Requirement:  ``django.core.context_processors.request`` must be present in your `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`.

    {% load geoaware %} # Or set `GEOIP_INCLUDE_TEMPLATE_TAGS = True` in your settings to auto include tags

    {{ request|geo_country_name }}
    {{ request|geo_country_code }}
    {{ request|geo_country_code3 }}
    {{ request|geo_city }}
    {{ request|geo_latitude }}
    {{ request|geo_longitude }}
    {{ request|geo_postal_code }}
    {{ request|geo_region }}
    {{ request|geo_dma_code }}
    {{ request|geo_area_code }}
    {{ request|geo_fqdn_or_ip }}
    {{ request|geo_charset }}


Running the tests
=================

To run the tests against the current environment:

    python manage.py test geoaware # ToDo

    Note: if you are running on localhost in DEBUG mode, then you can add to your settings.py 
          `GEOIP_DEBUG_DOMAIN_OR_IP = 'google.com'` OR `GEOIP_DEBUG_DOMAIN_OR_IP = 'some valid public ip'`. 
          This is for testing purposes ONLY.
